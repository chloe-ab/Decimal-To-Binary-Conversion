The purpose of this function is to include an optional parameter, and convert a user-entered integer from the decimal number system into the binary number system.
I recognize that there may be built-in methods or ways to achieve the conversion with less code, but this was done as a fun exercise with the aim of creating the desired functionality using as little
built-in code as possible as a challenge, and demonstrating an example of an optional parameter.
The function will only work for integers up to Int32 in size.
The first input parameter is the user-entered integer, and the second optional input parameter details the desired number of leading zeros (default is zero).
